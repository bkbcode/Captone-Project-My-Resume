    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Brandonlee. My specialities are in sales & marketing, crafting innovative solutions and campaigns that foster lead growth and propel sales.
        <br><br>
        With a track record of running my own marketing agency for 3 years, plus accumulating over 3 years of experience as a business developer in the startup and tech realm, I've refined my abilities in constructing scalable funnels and devising strategies to achieve business objectives.
        <br><br>
        I also currently serve as the Commercial, Marketing & Operations Director @The Random Stuff, a creative web & app development agency - bringing innovative and purposeful ideas to life.
        <br><br>
        My ever growing interest for all things tech, has now led me on the journey of becoming a software developer.
    </p>
